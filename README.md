# iostat Document
    iostat -xd      =
    iostat -p       =
    iostat -d       =
    iostat -dx 1    =   Continuously Refreshing
    iostat -d sda   =   Total Info

    Reads/second only:
        # iostat -dx sda | grep sda | awk '{ print $4; }'

    Writes/sec only:
        # iostat -dx sda | grep sda | awk '{ print $5; }'

    Reads/sec and writes/sec separated with a slash:
        # iostat -dx sda | grep sda | awk '{ print $4"/"$5; }'

    Overall IOPS (what most people talk about):
        # iostat -d sda | grep sda | awk '{ print $2; }'

## iostat detail
        # The IOPS for this device xvda is r/s + w/s = 100 + 50 =150
        # “r/s”         =   reads per second
        # “w/s”         =   writes per second
        # rkB/s         =   kilobytes read per second
        # wkB/s         =   kilobytes written per second
        # avgrq-sz      =   average size of each request in sectors
        # avgqu-sz      =   average queue length of the requests
        # “await”       =   average time (in milliseconds) that each request spent in the queue
        # “svctm”       =   average service time (in milliseconds) for each request
        # “%util”       =   percentage of time that the disk was active

# sar -d

Open and edit /etc/default/sysstat config file and change row from ENABLED=”false” to ENABLED=”true”

    # sudo /etc/default/sysstat
        ENABLED=”true”
    
    # sudo service sysstat restart
